Installation
------------

  $ git clone ...
  $ cd matrix-appservice-gitter
  $ npm install


Setup
-----

1. Create a github user to act as the relay bot itself in gitter chanels.
   Obtain the user's gitter API key by visiting
     https://developer.gitter.im/apps

2. Create a new Matrix room to act as the administration control room. Note
   its internal room ID.

2. Create `gitter-config.yaml`. This needs the following keys:

    gitter_api_key: [the API key obtained in step 1]

    matrix_homeserver: [http URL pointing at the homeserver]

    matrix_user_domain: [domain part of the homeserver's name. Used for
                         ghost username generation]

    matrix_admin_room: [the ID of the room created in step 2]

3. Pick/decide on a spare local TCP port number to run the application service
   on. This needs to be visible to the homeserver if that runs on another
   machine.

4. Generate the appservice registration file:

   $ node index.js --generate-registration --port $PORT

5. Copy the newly-generated `gitter-registration.yaml` file to the homeserver
   and restart it.

6. Start the actual application service.

   $ forever index.js --port $PORT

7. Invite the newly-created '@gitterbot:DOMAIN' user into the admin control
   room created at step 2.

The bridge should now be running.


Provisioning
------------

The bridge is controlled entirely by commands in the admin control room.

  > LINK [matrix room ID] [gitter room name]
  Creates a new link between the given matrix room ID and the gitter room name
  and joins the associated gitter room. The relay user must be invited to the
  matrix room for this to become functional.

  > UNLINK [matrix room ID or gitter room name]
  Disconnects the link associated with the given room and leaves the
  associated gitter room
